# TreasureHunters

# By Vivek Tallavajhala and Bisher Anadani

# Motivation
This goal of this project to build upon our skills in developing reinforcement learning models.
For this assignment we modeled using Q-Learning

# Requirements
We do the treasure hunting and monster fighting for you
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Think up a map-like environment with treasure, obstacles
and opponents
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how reinforcement learning can be
used to find treasure efficiently while avoiding obstacles
and opponents
5. Build one or more reinforcement policies to model
situational assessments, actions and rewards
programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other
supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

# Running the Program
Once project has been pulled to local computer, run "maze.py" in the terminal.
The Q-Learning model will then be run on the map also made in maze.py
